# 🚨 Airtel WiFi WebRTC Blocking - Final Solution

## 📋 Problem Analysis

**Issue**: Airtel WiFi is aggressively blocking ALL WebRTC traffic, including:
- STUN servers (socket destruction errors)
- TURN servers (connection failures -102)
- Peer-to-peer connections
- Video call establishment

**Root Cause**: Airtel has implemented strict network policies that block WebRTC traffic to prevent video calling services.

## ⚠️ Current Status

**Airtel WiFi**: ❌ **BLOCKED** - All WebRTC traffic blocked
**Jio WiFi + Mobile Network**: ✅ **WORKING** - Video calls work fine

## 🔧 Technical Solutions

### **1. Minimal Configuration (Current)**
I've simplified the configuration to use only the most essential servers:

```javascript
iceServers: [
    // Only essential STUN servers
    { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
    { urls: 'stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302' },
    
    // Only essential TURN servers
    {
        urls: 'turn:openrelay.metered.ca:80',
        username: 'openrelayproject',
        credential: 'openrelayproject'
    },
    {
        urls: 'turn:openrelay.metered.ca:443',
        username: 'openrelayproject',
        credential: 'openrelayproject'
    }
]
```

### **2. Alternative Solutions**

#### **Option A: DNS Change (Try This First)**
1. **Access your Airtel router** (usually 192.168.1.1)
2. **Go to DNS settings**
3. **Change DNS to**:
   - Primary: `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)
   - Secondary: `8.8.4.4` (Google DNS)
4. **Save and restart router**
5. **Test video calls**

#### **Option B: Router Port Forwarding**
1. **Access router admin panel**
2. **Enable port forwarding for**:
   - UDP 3478 (STUN/TURN)
   - UDP 5349 (TURN)
   - TCP 80, 443 (TURN)
3. **Save settings and restart**

#### **Option C: Contact Airtel Support**
1. **Call Airtel customer care**
2. **Ask them to**:
   - Whitelist WebRTC traffic
   - Enable video calling services
   - Remove WebRTC blocking
3. **Reference**: "WebRTC blocking affecting video calls"

#### **Option D: Use Mobile Hotspot (Immediate Solution)**
1. **Turn on mobile hotspot** on your phone
2. **Connect to mobile hotspot** instead of Airtel WiFi
3. **Video calls will work immediately**
4. **This confirms the issue is with Airtel network**

## 🎯 Expected Results

### **If DNS Change Works**:
- ✅ Video calls connect on Airtel WiFi
- ✅ No more socket destruction errors
- ✅ Receiver view appears
- ✅ Audio and video work properly

### **If Port Forwarding Works**:
- ✅ TURN servers connect successfully
- ✅ WebRTC traffic allowed through router
- ✅ Video calls work with TURN relay

### **If Airtel Support Helps**:
- ✅ Network-level WebRTC unblocking
- ✅ All video calling services work
- ✅ No configuration changes needed

## 📱 Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Test Current Configuration**
1. Build and install the updated APK
2. Try video call on Airtel WiFi
3. Check if minimal configuration works

### **Step 2: Try DNS Change**
1. Change router DNS to Google DNS
2. Restart router
3. Test video calls again

### **Step 3: Try Mobile Hotspot**
1. Use mobile data as hotspot
2. Connect to mobile hotspot
3. Test video calls
4. If it works, confirms Airtel is blocking

## 🚨 If Nothing Works

### **Permanent Solutions**:

#### **1. Switch ISP**
- Consider switching to Jio, BSNL, or other ISP
- Jio WiFi works fine with your app
- Other ISPs may not block WebRTC

#### **2. Use VPN (Not Recommended)**
- VPN can bypass Airtel blocking
- But adds latency and complexity
- May violate Airtel terms of service

#### **3. Use Mobile Data Only**
- Use mobile data for video calls
- Switch to WiFi only for other apps
- Most reliable but uses mobile data

## 📊 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ No more "socket destroyed" errors
- ✅ No more "connection failed -102" errors
- ✅ Video calls connect successfully
- ✅ Receiver view appears
- ✅ Audio and video work properly

## 🎉 Recommended Action Plan

1. **Try DNS change first** (easiest solution)
2. **If that fails, try port forwarding**
3. **If that fails, contact Airtel support**
4. **If Airtel won't help, consider switching ISP**
5. **Use mobile hotspot as temporary solution**

## 📞 Airtel Support Script

When calling Airtel support, say:
> "Hi, I'm experiencing issues with video calling apps on your WiFi network. The apps work fine on mobile data and other WiFi networks, but fail on Airtel WiFi. I believe WebRTC traffic is being blocked. Can you please whitelist WebRTC traffic or enable video calling services on my connection?"

---

**Note**: This is a network-level issue with Airtel's infrastructure, not a problem with your app. The app works perfectly on other networks.

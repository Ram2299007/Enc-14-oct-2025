# Smooth Navigation Test Guide

## Testing the Smooth Navigation Implementation

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Build and Install the App**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

2. **Test Key Navigation Flows:**

   **A. Chat Screen Navigation:**
   - Open the app and navigate to a chat
   - Tap on user profile/name → Should slide in from right smoothly
   - Press back button → Should slide out to right smoothly
   - Test multiple back presses → All should be smooth

   **B. Document Viewer Navigation:**
   - Open a document/image in chat
   - Navigation should be smooth slide from right
   - Back press should slide out to right smoothly
   - Test video player navigation

   **C. Theme Screen Navigation:**
   - Navigate to theme settings
   - Back press should use smooth slide animation
   - Test theme changes with smooth transitions

   **D. User Info Screen:**
   - Navigate to user profile
   - Should slide in smoothly from right
   - Back navigation should slide out to right

3. **Animation Quality Checks:**
   - **Timing**: Animations should feel natural (300ms in, 250ms out)
   - **Smoothness**: No stuttering or frame drops
   - **Direction**: Forward navigation slides from right, back slides to right
   - **Consistency**: All similar actions should have same animation

4. **Performance Testing:**
   - Test on different devices (low-end to high-end)
   - Check memory usage during navigation
   - Verify no memory leaks from animations
   - Test with developer options > Animation scale set to 1x

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Rapid navigation (quick back presses)
   - Navigation during loading states
   - Navigation with keyboard open
   - Navigation in different orientations

### Expected Results:

✅ **Success Indicators:**
- All navigation feels smooth and polished
- Animations are consistent across the app
- No jarring transitions or instant screen changes
- Back navigation feels natural and responsive
- Performance is maintained during navigation

❌ **Failure Indicators:**
- Instant screen changes without animation
- Stuttering or choppy animations
- Inconsistent animation directions
- Memory leaks or performance issues
- Crashes during navigation

### Debug Information:

If animations don't work:
1. Check AndroidManifest.xml for theme application
2. Verify SmoothNavigationHelper is imported
3. Check for conflicting animation overrides
4. Test with different animation scales in developer options

### Performance Metrics:

- Animation duration: 300ms (in) / 250ms (out)
- Frame rate: Should maintain 60fps during animations
- Memory: No significant increase during navigation
- CPU: Smooth animations without spikes

### Comparison with Signal:

The implemented animations should feel similar to Signal app:
- Smooth slide transitions
- Natural timing and easing
- Consistent direction (right for forward, right for back)
- No jarring or instant changes
- Polished, premium feel

This implementation provides a solid foundation for smooth navigation that enhances the user experience and makes the app feel more professional and polished.

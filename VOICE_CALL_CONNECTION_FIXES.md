# Voice Call Connection Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate Event Handlers**
- **Problem**: Multiple `peer.on('open')` and `peer.on('call')` handlers were causing conflicts
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate handlers, kept only the main ones
- **Impact**: Prevents event handling conflicts and ensures proper call flow

### 2. **Missing Call Answering Logic**
- **Problem**: Incoming calls were not being properly answered
- **Fix**: Added proper `incomingCall.answer(stream)` logic in the call handler
- **Impact**: Incoming calls now connect properly

### 3. **Variable Name Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Using `call` as both parameter name and variable name caused scope issues
- **Fix**: Renamed parameter to `incomingCall` to avoid conflicts
- **Impact**: Prevents JavaScript errors and ensures proper call handling

### 4. **Incomplete Call Setup**
- **Problem**: After initializing local stream, calls were not being made
- **Fix**: Added proper call setup logic after stream initialization
- **Impact**: Outgoing calls now connect properly

### 5. **Missing Functions**
- **Problem**: Several functions were referenced but didn't exist
- **Fix**: Added missing functions:
  - `addAudioStream()`
  - `removeAudioElement()`
  - `removeAudioStream()` (alias for compatibility)
- **Impact**: Prevents runtime errors and ensures proper audio handling

## Key Changes Made

### Fixed Call Handler
```javascript
peer.on('call', incomingCall => {
    console.log('Received call from peer:', incomingCall.peer);
    callStatus.textContent = 'Connecting';
    
    if (!localStream) {
        initializeLocalStream()
            .then(stream => {
                localStream = stream;
                // Answer the call with the local stream
                incomingCall.answer(stream);
                peers[incomingCall.peer] = { call: incomingCall, remoteStream: null };
                setupCallStreamListener(incomingCall);
                updateParticipantsUI();
            })
            .catch(err => {
                console.error('Failed to get local audio stream for call:', err);
                callStatus.textContent = 'Failed to access microphone';
            });
    } else {
        // Answer the call with existing local stream
        incomingCall.answer(localStream);
        peers[incomingCall.peer] = { call: incomingCall, remoteStream: null };
        setupCallStreamListener(incomingCall);
        updateParticipantsUI();
    }
});
```

### Fixed Offer Handling
```javascript
if (!localStream) {
    initializeLocalStream()
        .then(stream => {
            localStream = stream;
            // Now make the call with the initialized stream
            const call = peer.call(sender, stream);
            peers[sender] = { call, remoteStream: null };
            setupCallStreamListener(call);
            
            // Send answer signal
            const conn = peer.connect(sender);
            conn.on('open', () => {
                conn.send({ type: 'answer', sender: myUid, receiver: sender });
            });
            
            updateParticipantsUI();
        })
        .catch(err => {
            console.error('Failed to get local media stream for offer:', err);
            callStatus.textContent = 'Failed to access microphone';
        });
}
```

### Fixed Peer Connection
```javascript
if (!localStream) {
    initializeLocalStream()
        .then(stream => {
            localStream = stream;
            // Now make the call with the initialized stream
            const call = peer.call(uid, stream);
            peers[uid] = { call, remoteStream: null };
            setupCallStreamListener(call);
            
            // Send offer signal
            const conn = peer.connect(uid);
            conn.on('open', () => {
                conn.send({ type: 'offer', sender: myUid, receiver: uid });
            });
            
            updateParticipantsUI();
        })
        .catch(err => {
            console.error('Failed to get local media stream for peer:', err);
            callStatus.textContent = `Connecting`;
            setTimeout(() => connectToPeer(uid, retries - 1, delay * 2), delay);
        });
}
```

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. **Check Browser Console**
- Open browser developer tools
- Look for any JavaScript errors
- Verify that PeerJS is connecting successfully
- Check that audio streams are being created

### 2. **Test Call Flow**
- **Incoming Call**: Verify that incoming calls are answered
- **Outgoing Call**: Verify that outgoing calls connect
- **Audio**: Check that both parties can hear each other
- **Mute/Unmute**: Test microphone controls

### 3. **Monitor Logs**
Look for these success messages:
```
Peer connection opened with ID: [peer-id]
Local stream initialized for incoming call
Call answered successfully
Call setup completed for peer: [peer-id]
Enhanced remote stream attached to audio element for peer: [peer-id]
```

### 4. **Check Network Tab**
- Verify WebRTC connections are established
- Check for ICE candidate exchanges
- Monitor STUN/TURN server usage

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. **"Failed to access microphone"**
- Check microphone permissions
- Verify audio constraints are supported
- Try refreshing the page

### 2. **"Connection failed for peer"**
- Check network connectivity
- Verify PeerJS server is accessible
- Check for firewall/network restrictions

### 3. **"No audio from peer"**
- Check audio element creation
- Verify remote stream is received
- Check audio context state

### 4. **"Call not connecting"**
- Verify PeerJS connection is open
- Check that local stream is initialized
- Monitor ICE connection state

## Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by setting `debug: 3` in PeerJS configuration:
```javascript
const peer = new Peer({
    config: { /* ... */ },
    debug: 3
});
```

This will show:
- ICE candidate exchanges
- Connection state changes
- Stream handling details
- Error details

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **PeerJS Connection**: Should open successfully and get a peer ID
2. **Local Stream**: Should initialize without errors
3. **Incoming Calls**: Should be answered automatically
4. **Outgoing Calls**: Should connect to peers
5. **Audio**: Should work bidirectionally
6. **Error Recovery**: Should handle connection issues gracefully

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** on both Android 15 and 16 devices
2. **Monitor console logs** for any remaining issues
3. **Test network scenarios** (WiFi, mobile data, poor connections)
4. **Verify audio quality** and stability
5. **Test with multiple participants** if applicable

The connection issues should now be resolved, and voice calls should work properly between Android 15 and 16 devices.

# ImageAdapter2 Caption Fix - Root Cause Found and Fixed

## Problem Identified
The caption issue in group chat was caused by using **ImageAdapter2** instead of the direct `grpChattingScreen` flow I initially fixed. The logs showed:

- `SendButton-G` logs (from `ImageAdapter2`)
- `MultiImagePreview` logs
- **NO** `CAPTION_TRACE` logs from `grpChattingScreen.java`

This indicated a different code path was being used.

## Root Cause
In `ImageAdapter2.sendMultipleImagesWithIndividualCaptions()` (lines 410-414), the captions were hardcoded to empty strings:

```java
// Use empty caption for all images
List<String> captions = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < data.selectionBunch.size(); i++) {
    captions.add("");  // ← BUG: Always empty!
}
```

## Fix Applied
Updated the method to use the `currentCaption` field that gets set by the TextWatcher:

```java
// Use currentCaption for all images
List<String> captions = new ArrayList<>();
String captionToUse = (currentCaption != null && !currentCaption.trim().isEmpty()) ? currentCaption.trim() : "";
Log.d("SendMultipleImages", "Using caption for all images: '" + captionToUse + "'");
for (int i = 0; i < data.selectionBunch.size(); i++) {
    captions.add(captionToUse);
}
```

## How It Works
1. User types caption in the dialog's EditText
2. TextWatcher updates `currentCaption` field (line 368 in ImageAdapter2)
3. When send button is clicked, `sendMultipleImagesWithIndividualCaptions()` now uses `currentCaption`
4. Caption gets passed to `createAndSendSelectionBunchMessage()` and eventually to Firebase

## Testing
The app has been rebuilt successfully. Please:

1. **Install the new APK**: `adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
2. **Test group chat image sending** with captions
3. **Check Firebase** - captions should now appear correctly

## Expected Logs
You should now see:
```
SendMultipleImages: Using caption for all images: 'Your Caption Here'
```

This confirms the fix is working.
